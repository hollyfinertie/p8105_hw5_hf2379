#### Comment on Plot

The mean value for the control arm stayed roughly the same around 1.02
for 8 weeks while the mean value for the experiement arm increased to
5.12 by week 8. Assuming an increase in values is a good thing, the
experimental group improved compared to the control group over 8 weeks
of treatment.

## Problem 3:

``` r
library(broom)
set.seed(10)

sim_regression = function(n = 30, beta0 = 2, beta1, var = 50) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(n, 0, var)
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = sim_data)
  
  tidy(ls_fit)
    
}

sim_results_test = 
  rerun(10, sim_regression(beta1 = 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  select(estimate, p.value)

sim_results = 
  tibble(beta1_input = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = beta1_input, ~rerun(10, sim_regression(beta1 = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs) %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  select(beta1_input, estimate, p.value) 
```
