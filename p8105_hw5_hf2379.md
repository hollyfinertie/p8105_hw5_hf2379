``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
library(rvest)
```

    ## Loading required package: xml2

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'rvest'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
    ## 
    ##     pluck

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:readr':
    ## 
    ##     guess_encoding

``` r
library(readr)

set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

``` r
update_missing = function(x) {
  
  if(is.numeric(x)) {
    replace(x, is.na(x), round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1))
  }
  
  else if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    replace(x, is.na(x),"virginica")
  }
}

iris_no_missing = map_df(iris_with_missing, ~update_missing(.x))
```

## Problem 2

``` r
read_file = function(x) {
  
  y = read_csv(x)
  
}

file_df = tibble(
   file = list.files(path = "./data/"), 
   path = str_c("./data/", file))

dataset = file_df %>% 
  select(path) %>% 
  mutate(
    load = map(file_df %>% pull(path), read_file)
  ) %>% 
  select(path, load) %>% 
  unnest(cols = load) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8, 
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_", 
    values_to = "values"
  ) 
```
